# Oil-Production-Forecasting
1. Preprocessed time-series data from the Volve field, addressing missing values and feature selection for model readiness.
2. Employed data visualization to identify multicollinearity, enhancing feature selection and model robustness.
3. Excluded highly correlated features to prevent data leakage and improve predictive accuracy.
4. Built a linear regression model for oil production forecasting, utilizing data scaling and train-test splits.
5. Evaluated model performance with relevant metrics to ensure reliability for real-world application.
